        "details": "1. Add Drizzle ORM and node-postgres to the project dependencies. 2. Create a docker-compose.yml file to provision a PostgreSQL service, exposing necessary ports and setting environment variables for user, password, and database. 3. Configure Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL: create a drizzle.config.ts specifying the schema location, output directory for migrations, and PostgreSQL dialect. 4. Set up a .env file with the DATABASE_URL matching the docker-compose configuration. 5. Initialize Drizzle ORM connection in the codebase, following best practices for connection pooling and error handling. 6. Integrate Better-Auth, configuring it to use Drizzle as its adapter for session and user management. 7. Implement middleware to protect authentication routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected endpoints. 8. Update project documentation to include setup instructions for Docker, environment variables, and authentication flow. 9. Ensure all code follows project conventions and best practices for security and maintainability.",
