> A blazing-fast SSR starter powered by **React 19**, **Rspack**, and **Hono** ‚Äî engineered for modern development with cutting-edge performance, beautiful UI components, and secure production builds.

---

## üí° Motivation

I built this boilerplate out of a growing need to break free from the limitations imposed by popular frameworks like Next.js and Remix.

While those frameworks offer great DX, their performance often relies heavily on specific deployment architectures (like Vercel for Next.js). This can result in unnecessary complexity, vendor lock-in, and suboptimal flexibility for developers who want full control over their stack.

This boilerplate is my answer to that problem ‚Äî a lean, fast, and unopinionated SSR setup using:

‚úÖ React with full flexibility,

‚úÖ Rspack for blazing fast builds,

‚úÖ Hono for a lightweight and modern web server,

‚úÖ Manual control over server-side data fetching, hydration, and routing.

No limits. No lock-in. Just raw power and freedom.
